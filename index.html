			We had four assignments, view the console log for my outputs.
		</p>
		<p>
			1. Write a program that checks if a variable is less than 10. If it is, alert the user that their variable is less than 10. If it is not, let the user know what the variable was and that it was greater than 10.
		</p>
		<p>
			2.  Declare a function that takes a name as an argument and tells the user what name they've entered, try invoking it after it has been declared
		</p>
		<p>
			3. Declare a function that takes no arguments but prints something to the console, try invoking it after it has been declared.
			<span class="amcComments">I didn't know how to do this one.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			4.  Create a `for` loop that "sings" the classic song "99 Bottles of Root Beer on the Wall". The code it outputs to the console should look similar to this:  "99 ttles of root beer on the wall, 99 bottles of root beer...take one down, pass it around 98 bottles of root beer on the wall, 98 bottles of root beer on the wall, 98 bottles of root beer...take one down, pass it around 97 bottles of root beer on the wall," etc., all the way to 0 bottles.
			<span class="amcComments">I couldn't figure out a way to get the last line to say "one bottle" instead of "one bottleS"</span>.
